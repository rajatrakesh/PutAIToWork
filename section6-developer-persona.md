# Section 6. Now Assist for the Developer Persona

**Estimated time: 10 minutes**

This section will examine how Now Assist for Creator provides power tools for developers to support Service Operations.

### Step 1: Access Workflow Studio

1. Open **Workflow Studio** (All > Process Automation > Workflow Studio). The ServiceNow platform uses workflows to orchestrate process steps and integrate them into systems; Flow Designer is used to build out those workflows.
