## Access Skill Kit

Now Assist Skill Kit (NASK) allows you to create new generative AI skills using the generic Now LLM or your own LLM.  NASK has been designed to easily manage and integrate new skills into the ServiceNow platform via a UI Action and soon into the Now Assist Panel. With NASK you define the input data, leverage tools to process the data, activate the new skill, and deploy it to the platform.

For our use case we will use NASK to send a prompt to the LLM asking it to review the contents of our knowledge article, and to provide suggestions on how to improve it. This feedback will be stored in a Feedback Task attached to the knowledge article.

Prior to running this lab, please ensure that you create a knowledge article with the following content. This has some intentional grammaer, spelling and structural issues. 

```
R u having trouble with ur Outlook inbox? It can b a real pain in the butt when things aren't working rite, huh? Well, let me break it down 4 u and give u sum tips on how to fix those pesky issues.

First of all, one common problem peepl have with their Outlook inbox is that emails are not showing up or they r disappearing randomly. This can b super frustrating, especially if you're waiting for an important email. One possible reason for this is that ur inbox is getting too full and causing Outlook to glitch out. So, what u can do is try clearing out sum old emails or moving them to a different folder to free up sum space.

Another issue u might encounter is that ur inbox is running super slow or freezing up. This could be due to a bunch of different factors, like a slow internet connection, a bug in the Outlook program, or a problem with ur computer's hardware. To help speed things up, try closing out of any unnecessary programs or tabs, restarting ur computer, and checking for any updates to the Outlook program.

Sumtimes, u might find that emails r not sending or receiving properly in ur inbox. This could b because of incorrect email settings, a problem with ur internet connection, or issues with the recipient's email server. To troubleshoot this problem, double-check ur email settings to make sure everything is set up correctly, restart ur internet connection, and reach out to ur email provider if necessary.

Overall, dealing with issues in ur Outlook inbox can b a real headache. But by following these tips and staying patient, u should b able to troubleshoot and fix those problems like a pro. Good luck!

Ensure that you save the number of the knowledge article that you just created. We will be using it later. 

Now let's build the custom skill. 

Type ```Now Assist Skill Kit``` in the function list. 

![Skill Kit](screenshots/na-skill-kit.png)

Click create new skill. 

Name the skill Knowledge Article Coach. In this lab, we will be using the Now LLM service to complete our task, so ensure the Default provider and Provider API values are both set to Now LLM Generic.

![Skill Kit](screenshots/na-create-skill.png)

Add a new skill input by clicking the plus icon next to it. This is where we add the reference to a knowledge article to use within the prompt.

![Skill Kit](screenshots/na-new-skill-input.png)

Populate the skill input form as seen below, replacing the test record with the number of your knowledge article from phase 1. Once complete, click Add skill input.

![Skill Kit](screenshots/na-add-new-skill-input.png)

[Optional] Click the Pencil Icon next to the prompt name to rename the prompt. We are renaming it to Knowledge Coach here. Click Save changes.

![Skill Kit](screenshots/na-knowledge-coach.png)

In the prompt field, remove the template text and replace it with the following:

```
You are an AI model specialized in evaluating the quality of knowledge base articles on IT issues. A knowledge base article that covers a specific IT topic will be presented. Your task is to perform a quality check on the article by evaluating it against the following criteria:


Rubric for quality check:
1. Clarity and Conciseness: The article should be easy to understand, with clear, concise language that avoids unnecessary jargon.
2. Comprehensiveness: The article should cover all necessary aspects of the issue, including steps for resolution, potential pitfalls, and any additional resources.
3. Grammar and Language Use: The article should be free from spelling, grammar, and punctuation errors, and the language should be professional and appropriate for the audience.
4. Usability: The article should be organized in a user-friendly manner, with clear headings and step-by-step instructions that help the user navigate the content.


Evaluation Instructions:
- Each criterion should be evaluated as either "Satisfactory" or "Unsatisfactory."
- If a criterion is evaluated as "Satisfactory," provide no additional explanation.
- If a criterion is evaluated as "Unsatisfactory," provide a brief explanation of why the article does not meet the criteria.
- By the end of the evaluation, if one or more criteria were deemed "Unsatisfactory," provide overall improvement suggestions.


Article to be assessed:
```

Click in the text box to add your cursor focus to the end of the prompt. (i.e. have the flashing line appear after the text ‚ÄúArticle to be assessed‚Äù). Click Insert inputs.

**Test the custom skill**

Scroll down to the Test prompt section. Click Run tests.

![Skill Kit](screenshots/na-skill-run-tests.png)

From the dialog box that appears, verify which knowledge article you wish to test your skill against, then click Run Tests.

![Skill Kit](screenshots/na-test-skill.png)

Verify the output from the LLM is to your liking. You can iterate upon the provided prompt if you desire.

![Skill Kit](screenshots/na-skill-output.png)

To verify if information from your skill inputs is being brought in correctly, click on the tab named Grounded prompt. You will see the input that was delivered to the LLM, including your knowledge article text.

![Skill Kit](screenshots/na-skill-grounded-prompt.png)

Once content with the output of your skill, click Finalize prompt.

![Skill Kit](screenshots/na-skill-finalize-prompt.png)

**Deploy the custom skill**

Click on Skill settings at the top of the page.

    var output = sn_one_extend.OneExtendUtil.execute(request)['capabilities'][request.executionRequests[0].capabilityId]['response'];

   

      var newFeedback = new GlideRecord("kb_feedback");

newFeedback.initialize();

newFeedback.article = current.sys_id;

var feedbackSysId= newFeedback.insert();


      var newTask = new GlideRecord("kb_feedback_task");

        newTask.initialize();

        newTask.assigned_to = gs.getUserID();

         newTask.feedback = feedbackSysId;

        newTask.short_description = "Knowledge Article Feedback generated by NowLLM";

        newTask.description = JSON.parse(output).model_output;

        var newTaskSysid = newTask.insert();


        //get the link to the new case/incident

        var mylink = '<a href="https://INSTANCE URL.service-now.com/kb_feedback_task.do?sys_id='+newTaskSysid.toString()+'">here</a>';
