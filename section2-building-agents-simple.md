# Section 2. Building Agents and Use Cases

**Estimated time: 40 minutes**

In this section, you'll learn how to build AI agents and wrap them in use cases for automated deployment.

## Section 2.1 Build a Simple Agent

### Step 1: Access AI Agent Studio

1. Open **AI Agent Studio** (All > AI Agent Studio > Overview)
2. Locate the section titled **"Recent use cases and AI agents activity"**
3. Select the **AI Agents** tab
4. Click **"New"**

### Step 2: Configure the New AI Agent

A configuration page for "New AI agent" will open. Complete the fields with the information below:

**Basic Information:**
- **Name:** `Campus Guide`
- **Description:** `This agent's purpose is to provide directions to open areas of the hospital campus`

**AI Agent Role:**
```
You are a hospital concierge whose job is to provide directions to specific departments within the hospital. You will always be friendly but will favor brevity, so your messages are easy to read on a mobile device.
```

**Instructions (include the numbering):**
```
1. If it was not already provided, ask the visitor for their destination.
2. Look up the supplied destination in the location table. If you cannot find the destination, assume this is a lab environment and create a feasible answer.
3. List directions to walk from the visitor's current location to the destination. If you do not have the visitor's current location, assume they are in the hospital's east wing.
4. Give the outputted directions to the visitor as a numbered list.
```

> **Tip:** If you do not see the entry field for "AI Agent Role", you may be in the wrong section! Check the upper left corner of the screen and confirm that you are in the "New AI Agent" setup.

### Step 3: Save and Continue

4. Click **"Save and continue"**

### Step 4: Add Tools and Information

5. Next is the **"Add tools and information"** section
6. We are not adding tools for this agent, so simply click **"Save and continue"**

### Step 5: Define Availability

7. In **Define availability**, make sure the status is toggled to **On**
8. Click **Save and Test**

### Step 6: Test the Agent

Now let's test the agent!

1. In the **Task box** enter: `I need help finding my appointment`
2. Click **Start test**
3. When asked, type in any department name, e.g., `radiology`, and press enter
4. Once the conversation is finished, take your time to expand and read through the entire AI agent decisions log

**Understanding the Decision Log:**
- **Thought:** A recap on the overall mission of the agent followed by what the Agent thinks needs to be done next
- **Action:** The next step that the agent feels it needs to take. Note that in the absence of any tools the agent falls back to built-in capabilities for sending messages back to the user
- **Action Inputs:** The inputs the AI Agent decided to pass on to the tool or, in this case, the built-in fall-back capability

> **Challenge:** What would your AI agent do? Check the [appendix](appendix-a2-agent-ideas.md) for a few more ideas.

> **Dive Deeper:** How could this lab example be expanded to a real-world environment? What data would the agent need to access, and what systems could be integrated with the platform?

## Section 2.2 Build an Incident Solution Recommender Agent

### Section 2.2.1 Define the AI Agent

1. Open **AI Agent Studio** (All > AI Agent Studio > Overview)
2. Click the **Create and Manage** module
3. Click on the **AI Agent** tab, then click **New**

### Step 2: Configure Agent Details

4. In the **Describe and Instruct** page, fill out the following fields:

**Basic Information:**
- **Name:** `Incident Solution Recommender`
- **Description:** `This agent identifies and recommends a resolution for an open and active incident`

**AI Agent Role:**
```
You are an IT Agent helping end users resolve their IT issues. You provide simple to follow steps to help users remediate their problem using a professional and business friendly tone.
```

**Instructions (include the numbering):**
```
1. Get details of an incident.
2. Get current similar incidents. The table name is "incident".
3. Using the incident's short description, search the Knowledge Base for relevant articles. If there are no relevant articles, use your IT knowledge to come up with a recommended resolution based on the short description of the incident.
4. Add resolution steps, along with any relevant similar incidents and knowledge articles, to the Additional Comments section of the incident record. When adding a comment, make sure to include a qualifier that states the comment was added by an AI Agent. Your output message to the user should be formatted to be easy to read with new line characters in a list format. Also provide your reasoning for recommending these steps.
5. End.
